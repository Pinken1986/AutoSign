# AutoSign (Open Source, Work in Progress)

AutoSign is an open-source Bukkit/Spigot plugin for Minecraft that aims to automate the process of smelting items using signs, chests, and furnaces. The goal is to allow players to create automatic smelting setups without the need for complex redstone contraptions.

**Note: While significant progress has been made, this project is still in development and may not be fully functional. As an open-source project, we welcome and encourage contributors to help improve and expand the plugin!**

## Planned Features

- Create automatic smelting setups using signs
- Support for "give" signs (transfer items from chest to furnace)
- Support for "take" signs (transfer smelted items from furnace to chest)
- Automatic datapack creation and updates
- Easy setup and configuration
- Flexible placement of chests and furnaces relative to the sign

## Current State

The project currently includes:

- Basic plugin structure
- Sign detection and processing
- Datapack generation logic
- Flexible chest and furnace detection relative to signs

While the core functionality has been implemented, the plugin may still have bugs or limitations and needs further testing and refinement.

## TODO

- Expand and refine the core sign processing logic
- Implement more robust error handling and edge case management
- Expand datapack functionality
- Add configuration options for customization
- Implement a more comprehensive permission system
- Create and expand test suite
- Optimize performance for large-scale use
